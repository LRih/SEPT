richard
7:15 PM Right guys, since GitHub wasn't mentioned in the individual assessment post I'm going to learn JIRA just to be safe
brenton_kelly
7:59 PM Yeah it is mentioned mate, "Or a code respository /versioning tool (e.g github, bitbucket)"
marcel
8:00 PM Was about to say
brenton_kelly
8:02 PM
marcel
8:02 PM Did you want to split ucd/user stories as well+
brenton_kelly
8:03 PM If there's nothing else to do this week, may as well :+1:
marcel
8:13 PM Too easy, chuck stream link ;)
richard
9:07 PM Thanks guys, when it was first posted "OR a code repository/versioning tool" wasn't there, unless I'm blind
marcel
10:39 AM Okay guys so as far as I'm concerned today we're showing off Slack, GitHub, Trello and Lucid?
richard
10:40 AM Jira instead of github
marcel
10:40 AM Ah okay. So Jira in place of git and we're good?
richard
10:41 AM Yep
marcel
10:43 AM Too easy, I'll get a quick ucd draft going for the lucid, I'm guessing you're just setting up the Jira and showing that it's a thing? I dont really know lol
richard
10:46 AM Yeah showing how it works and why teams would use it
marcel
12:27 PM Hey guys, running late - in the case he checks by the time I get there, here's a link to the lucid chart folder so that he can see we know how to use it.https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/cb6bb605-9bd2-4841-b36c-ebced3ebb83c
brenton_kelly
12:32 PM That's pretty 'slack' of you heheh
marcel
12:32 PM Ayyyyyyyyyyy
brenton_kelly
12:55 PM Any idea when you'll get here @marcel
Individual assessment, so don't want you to miss out on an easy 3%
marcel
1:01 PM Like 10-15 minutes
1:02
Is he doing it now?
brenton_kelly
1:02 PM Aight easy
Nah we're last on the board
richard
1:37 PM I've added a basic documentation template to the repository
1:37
Feel free to change
brenton_kelly
8:05 AM Sorry that I've been under the radar for the past few days.
I have uploaded a Python script which uses BeautifulSoup and Python Requests to gather all the JSON links for all the weather stations.
I have also uploaded it's output .json file. I can adjust the script if we require a different format for the project.
8:06
(Both files are uploaded on Trello, in the 'Python BeautifulSoup Script' card)
richard
10:40 AM No worries, that's great
10:40
I've added both files in git under the folder
BOM Links
richard
10:44 AM

{

	"city": Hopetoun Airport

	"url": www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDV60801/IDV60801.94838.json

},

â€‹

@brenton_kelly: If you may can you make these few changes
richard
10:44 AM Surround values in quotes
10:45
Comma after city value and "http://" before urls
10:45
Thanks
marcel
9:58 PM hey guys sorry for ALSO being under the rader - turns out sibling weddings really take it out of you
How are we storing the json links?
richard
10:32 AM Lets see, it's not 100% decided. We'll discuss it in the tute. You coming?
marcel
10:33 AM Yes sir!
marcel
12:50 PM Anybody else coming?
richard
3:07 PM
javadoc and jars.pdf

90KB PDF Click to open original
Hey @marcel, it appears we do have to do that oracle style documentation for all functions and parameters
richard
11:04 PM Some input guys: right now the favorites will be saved as JSON format upon closing and loaded at launch
11:04
When loading there are two potential errors: IO and parse (i.e. file is malformed)
11:04
Any idea what we should do in both cases?
marcel
12:39 PM Hey I'm running late - not missing anything important am I?
richard
12:47 PM Nope
brenton_kelly
1:44 PM Hey, sorry i'm not there right now.  Ran into an umexpected family e
mergency. Not sure if I will catch the end or not.
Sorry again :(
marcel
1:50 PM All good man we bailed already
richard
2:52 PM No worries
marcel
12:47 AM hey, did a couple things over the weekend with code documentation and such - just working on the 2 sequence diagrams now.
I do apologize, Computing Theory assignment 1 was due tonight so I was grinding that bad boy out :disappointed:
marcel
1:29 AM sorted
1:29
how is this submitted?
richard
8:59 PM It's cool
8:59
I believe it's submitted on blackboard
8:59
as a zip
9:00
I saw the sequence diagrams good work
9:00
I found out we also need to do system level tests cases involving the UI
9:01
Quan is currently working on that but when it's ready we can do the test cases
9:01
I've written an example here:
9:01
https://github.com/QuanDhz/SEPT/blob/master/Part%201%20Submission/Test%20Documentation/System%20tests.txt
9:01
We need 8 so I propose 2 each?
marcel
9:01 PM I'll do two tonight!
richard
9:02 PM It's UI level so you might need to modify it later on if the UI doesn't match the test case
quando
4:31 AM
Our UI so far
quando
4:33 AM
First Screen
brenton_kelly
5:35 AM Looking very impressive!
I'll knock out at least 2 test cases tonight. As for the java project, is there any particular part you want me working on? Or should I just work on producing lots of documents/diagrams etc?
richard
8:03 PM I think just documents and diagrams right now
8:03
Sequence diagrams may have to be updated since the code has changed
8:08
I remember something to do with writing about licenses for the libraries we are using
8:08
If so that also needs to be done in the documentation html
brenton_kelly
8:28 PM Sounds good (y)
marcel
8:29 PM if you've got a list of libraries used i will bomb the html with licenses
richard
8:29 PM It's in the documentation html
8:29
under licenses
marcel
12:22 PM sorted licenses
12:22
can do component diagram and tests later?
12:22
I have work now
marcel
10:21 AM is it absolutely necessary to come in today? thinking of staying in and getting shit done
richard
10:35 AM Not really so don't worry about it
marcel
10:35 AM sweet - gives me precious time
richard
10:37 AM Come next week though I hear there's an accessed lab
10:37
Assessed*
marcel
10:38 AM yeah man will defs - just trying to juggle apt and this shit at the same time is not fun
richard
7:45 PM Hey @marcel did you commit the license documentation?
marcel
7:46 PM oh shit sorry i did not
7:46
whoops
richard
7:46 PM Lol yeah was wondering
richard
3:40 PM Apparently it's recommended we use a tool for our system tests so I've created an account on lean testing
3:40
I've sent you all invitations
marcel
3:41 PM noticed, is it easy to use?
richard
4:40 PM Yeah seems easy enough
4:42
You want to aim for submitting tomorrow night?
4:43
There are bonus marks if it's submitted by the original due date
4:43
We are nearly there I think, just test cases, and fix up the second sequence diagram
4:43
And the app is in a usable state
marcel
8:15 PM can do good friendo
