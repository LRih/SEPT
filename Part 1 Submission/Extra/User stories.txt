As a user I want to keep track of weather stations I view frequently.
Given the user is viewing the "Add Station" screen and have a station selected,
when they click the "Add to My Favorites" button then the station will be added
to the favourites list.

As a user I want to find weather stations closest to my physical location.
No confirmation as of yet.

As a paranoid weather skeptic I want to always have the most updated data displayed.
Given the user is connected to the internet, when the app is launched then the
most recent data will be automatically fetched.

As a user I want to have data displayed in graphical form to better understand the trends in weather patterns.
Given the user is on the main screen and has a station selected, when
"View Chart" is clicked then charts are shown to the user.

As a curious user I want to be able to view Antarctic weather data in addition to weather data from Australia.
Given the user is viewing the "Add Station" screen, when the state "Antarctica"
is selected then the user has the option of selecting a station from Antarctica.

As a user I want to be able to access weather data (albeit outdated) even without an internet connection.
Given the user has previously loaded station data while connected to the
internet, when the app is launched without an internet connection then locally
cached data will be loaded.

— PART 2 —
As a curious user, I want to check forecast from different sources.
So that I can compare the accuracy and decide which source is more reliable.
