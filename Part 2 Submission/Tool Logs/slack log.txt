1:49 PM Also I went on the website we need to pull data from, went on their data sources list and was overwhelmed!
There's so many!! What do?
richard
4:52 PM Think the demo next week is like the JUnit test

doesn't matter if we use the same tool
4:52
they will give us a bug and we have to demonstrate that we can issue track it
4:52
But there is also bitbucket, JIRA, leantesting
brenton_kelly
9:42 PM It seems like leantesting should make the demo super easy :)
